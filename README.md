# Ansible Automation.
Practical task for internship

At RedCarpet, we take security very seriously. The security/devops intern will also get "golden keys" - the main admin access to all our servers across India. 
You will be expected to learn and contribute to devops (https://cloud.google.com/devops/) as well as site reliability engineering (https://landing.google.com/sre/).
 
So we expect you to learn tools and be a good devops coder as well. Remember, we know that you may not know how to do this. We are expecting you to learn and do the interview. 
 
1. You will use Ansible to do server hardening. e.g. http://isa.com.gh/2018/05/how-to-automate-pentesting-with-ansible-part-1-installation-configuration/ or https://github.com/juju4/ansible-harden-windows/tree/master/tasks
2. Sign up for a free AWS/DigitalOcean/Vultr account. You will get free credits.
3. Create a linux Ubuntu server.
4. Do the following using ansible:
  4.1 Setup Docker
  4.1 Setup Kubernetes.
  4.3 Harden the server against attacks - you figure out what to do here. Use your security experience to secure the server.
